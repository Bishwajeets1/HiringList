# HiringList
Display this list of items to the user based on the following requirements:

KeyPoints:-

1. I have used MVVM pattern
2. Have used Dagger and Hilt for Dependency Injection
3. Have used State flow to update data
4. Used Jetpack compose(Lazy column) to display results
5. Have used Sealed classes for Error Handling
6. Have Used ViewModel to manage rotation of Device
7. I have grouped items by "listId", sorted them by "listId" and then "name", and filtered out items with a blank or null "name".
   processHiringList() inside HiringViewModel does these operations.
8. Screenshot attached:-
